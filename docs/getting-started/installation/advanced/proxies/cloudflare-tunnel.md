# Cloudflare Tunnel (Zero Trust)

A [Cloudflare tunnel](https://www.cloudflare.com/nl-nl/products/tunnel/) can be used as a reverse proxy in front of Speedtest Tracker when you want to expose the application publicly without exposing your IP address.

## Cloudflare Tunnel Configuration

* Update your `APP_URL` to the public URL you are going to use and restart the service.
* In the Cloudflare panel go to **Zero Trust** -> **Networks** -> **Tunnels** page.
* For the tunnel you want to add the Speedtest Tracker to click on **Edit** or add a new tunnel.
* Go to **Public Hostname.**
* Click on **Add a public hostname.**
* Fill in the following fields:
  * **Subdomain:** The subdomain you want to access the Speedtest Tracker on.
  * **Domain:** The domain you want to access the Speedtest Tracker on.
  * **Type:** Connection type to the Speedtest Tracker (http/https)
    * When choosing HTTPS you will need to disable the TLS verification under `Additional application settings -> TLS -> No TLS Verify`
  * **URL:** The URL to access the Speedtest Tracker. This can be either the IP Address:Port or the container_name:port.

    When using the container_name Cloudflare Tunnel and Speedtest Tracker need to be on the same Docker network.
