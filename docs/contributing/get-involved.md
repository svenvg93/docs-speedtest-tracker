# Get involved

## How to contribute

As Open Source software, Speedtest Tracker benefits from different kinds of contributions
from the community of its users. Our open approach allows you to:

* __Contribute code__ in response to an issue by creating a pull request that
  fixes a bug, introduces a new feature, or improves performance or code
  quality.

* __Help improve the documentation__ to ensure it is consistent, understandable,
  and that readers can find the information they are looking for.
